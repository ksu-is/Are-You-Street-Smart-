	> **Note:** Was unable to run the code from the original repsoitory found (https://github.com/ir2010/Quiz-in-Python-with-GUI) because of a missing module, but should be beneficial to this repository as time progresses. However, I did find another code that ran well (https://github.com/ajcollier93/Quiz_Template); although it is a simple template, the code works and is similar to my idea.
